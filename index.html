            <p> &#127812; You stumble upon an odd looking circle in the grassy field! &#127812;
                <br> &#127812; Taking a closer look at the peculiar shape, you step in the circle to find a fairy grinning back at you! &#127812;
                <br> &#127812; "Hehehe, why hello there! Nice to meet you!" Snickering, the fairy looks at you standing within their circle of mushrooms. &#127812;
                <br> &#127812; "Well well, looks like you stepped right in my trap! Now you have to play with me! &#127812;
                 <br> &#127812; I'll give you five tries to guess the number I am thinking about between 1-20! Very simple I promise! &#127812;
                 <br> &#127812; If <em>you</em> win you can leave! If <em>I</em> win, you have to continue playing with me forever and I get to take your name! &#127812;
                 <br> &#127812; <em><strong>THIS IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN!</strong></em>" &#127812;
